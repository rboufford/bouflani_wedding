        <h2>Practical Questions</h2>

        <p><strong>Do I need to rent a car?</strong><br/>
          Yes. The park is spread out and you’ll want a car to explore and to get to the ceremony site.</p>

        <p><strong>Is there cell service in Death Valley?</strong><br/>
          Sometimes near the resort, often not in the park. Download offline maps before exploring.</p>

        <p><strong>Do I need a National Park pass?</strong><br/>
          You typically need an entrance fee/pass to enter the park. If you already have an annual pass, bring it.</p>

        <p><strong>What time should I be in the lobby on Saturday?</strong><br/>
          <strong>12:45 PM</strong>. The caravan leaves at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> and that’s the one time we need everyone on schedule.</p>

        <p><strong>Are restrooms available at the ceremony?</strong><br/>
          No facilities at the ceremony site—please use the restroom before leaving the hotel. (See Ceremony Info for details.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What Not to Worry About</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Perfect hair.</strong> Desert breeze is basically a guest.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowing everything.</strong> If you make the lobby meet + caravan, you’re doing amazing.</li>
          <li><strong>Dust.</strong> You’re in Death Valley. It’s part of the charm and the story.</li>
          <li><strong>Being “overdressed.”</strong> The Oasis is a vibe. Lean in.</li>
          <li><strong>Not exploring enough.</strong> Even one scenic stop counts. We just want you to enjoy it.</li>
        </ul>

              We picked this place for the beauty and the experience—comfort wins over perfection.

      <h2>Additional FAQ</h2>

      <p><strong>Can I wear heels at the ceremony site?</strong><br/>
        Not recommended. Consider a block heel, wedges, or a shoe change. You can bring heels to change into for photos if you'd like.</p>

      <p><strong>Why are you making us hike in wedding clothes?</strong><br/>
        Because we are bougie granola. We have planned every stop, including the ceremony site, to minimize any walking required to get to the destination. You will have to walk on small rocks a very short distance, but you will not have to “hike” anywhere.</p>

      <p><strong>What if I get lost?</strong><br/>
        Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye. If that doesn’t work, then make sure you have offline maps downloaded before heading out or reference the directions in the document.</p>

      <p><strong>Will there be bugs?</strong><br/>
        There shouldn’t be, one of the perks of the desert in the winter.</p>

      <p><strong>Will there be animals?</strong><br/>
        We could get lucky with a Big Horn sheep sighting at the ceremony, we’ve seen them there once before. But given the large group of humans it is doubtful any animals will come around.</p>
    
      <p><strong>Do I need to be “outdoorsy” to enjoy this weekend?</strong><br/>
        Absolutely not. You can stay at the resort during the down time and relax. We recommend you take a dip in the pool which is spring-fed and 87 degrees year-round.</p>
   
      <p><strong>Who suggested getting married in Death Valley?</strong><br/>
        Zsanelle did! This suggestion surprised Ryan and made him fall further in love with her. This location is symbolic of how they have grown together and genuinely appreciate one another’s interests.</p>

      <p><strong>Why are we here?</strong><br/>
        Because you are our people. You’re part of our story. You’ve supported us, shaped us, laughed with us, and loved us. We are thrilled to celebrate this moment with the people who mean the most to us and we are incredibly grateful you are here to be part of it!</p>

      <h2>Fun “About Us” Questions</h2>
      <p class="small">Bridal-shower style. Answer in your head. Or out loud.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to plan a trip down to the minute?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to ignore the plan and “just vibe” anyway?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who takes 40 photos of the same thing to get one perfect shot?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who says “we should leave by 8” and then leaves at 9:30?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to befriend a stranger and learn their life story in 4 minutes?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to order dessert first?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to insist we don’t need a cart… and then immediately need a cart?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to suggest camping… and who is more likely to suggest a spa?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to bring snacks?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who is more likely to say “one drink” and mean “three drinks”?</strong></li>
      </ul>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
      <h2>One Last Question</h2>
      <p><strong>Why did we invite you?</strong><br/>
        Because you’re part of our closest circle—people who’ve shaped us, supported us, made us laugh, kept us grounded,
        and loved us through different seasons of life.</p>

      <p>
        We don’t take it lightly that you’re spending your time (and traveling to the middle of the desert!) to be with us.
        Having you here isn’t just meaningful—it’s the whole point.
